# Day 9 - API consumption

This day we learnt how to consume API from the internet using the https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke API. We used this API because it has no API key and API key security is not something we want to think about at this moment. We also took inspiration from this design - https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db

All the components used in this code are discussed in previous classes. 

Revisit day_6 for idea about fetch API

## IMPORTANT - Homework

Search the internet to find a few good APIs you would like to use and if you are enthusiastic, make a web application with that API key. (Don't upload it to github yet, show it to me in person)
