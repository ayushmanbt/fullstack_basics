# Day 4 and 5 (and possibly day 6)

In these days we were working on an interactive todo application. 

Upto now we have implemented

- We learnt how to use different HTML, CSS and JS knowledge to implement an application.
- We lerant about the `forEach` loops again
- We learnt about higher order functions on array like `map`, `reduce`, `filter` (we only used `filter` for this problem) we will talk more about these functions in the next class
- We applied `getElementById`, `addEventListener`, `innerHTML` and form field `value` to add interactivity to our application
- We learnt about CSS attribute based selectors `element[attribute=value]{style to apply}` and parallel selector to select same level element `element1 + element2` which gets `element2` which is located parallel to `element1` visually this HTML is like -
```html
<element1>
    ...
</element1>
<element2>
    ...
</element2>  <!-- This element is targetted -->
```
- Day 5 bonus content (after most of you went to watch the football match) A way to center a div only horizontally with `margin: auto`
- challenge for you is to take the code and implement a system so that you can fix the todo status resetting on deleting the todo
- we learnt about the `*` selector to select anything in HTML
- (BONUS) We talked a bit about psudoelements.
