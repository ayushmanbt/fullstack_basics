# Old Gaps disuccion

In today's shortened class we discussed a few topics which might have been left out during our covering of topics 

## HTML table 

We use the following tags to create table

table - this encapsulates our table
tr - this denotes a row of the table
th - denotes heading of table
td - table data, used to denote each cell of a table

In HTML Table we can use colspan and rowspan attributes to make multi row or multi column layouts

### CSS related to table 

We can use the `border-collapse: collapse;` property collapse dual borders and give a uni border.

## Window and Document object

Window object is different from the document object, where the document object manipulates the document and the window object has access to the window.
