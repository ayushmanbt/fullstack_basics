# Day 10 knowledge

- We learnt about the most common MVC pattern in the backend
- We learnt about backend frameworks using different languages like JavaScript (Node.js, Express), Go (Gin), PHP and Laravel, Python (Django, Flask, FastAPI)
- We learnt about monolith and microserver architecture. 
- If someone wants to learn more in the future they can pursue / learn a fullstack framework like Next.js
- Never, (I repeat never) commit node modules to your git repository.
- We saw how a simple backend might look in express and python
- To run this one install node.js and then run `npm run dev` (Cause we are using `scripts` in `package.json`)
